## KNOWNS ISSUES

## IDEAS

- add filters (user, blog, date(range), ‚Ä¶) to the list

## TODO

- list existing notices (with pagination)
- add maintenance task to remove all notices periodically (if possible)
- cope with blog admins (restricted to blog's notice) and super admin (all plateform's blogs notices)
